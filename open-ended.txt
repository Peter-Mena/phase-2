question one: Explain the different types of files in Linux (regular, directory, symbolic link, device, etc.) and how to check them with commands.

regular: The most common type. Contains data, text, scripts, images, binaries, etc.
command: ls -l filename

directory: A special file that contains references (entries) to other files and directories.
command: ls -ld directoryname

symbolic link: A pointer to another file or directory. It's like a shortcut.
command: ls -l symlink_name

Hard Link: Another name for an existing file (points to the same inode).it's like a copy.
command: ls -l

device: Provides unbuffered access to hardware devices, one character at a time (e.g., terminals, serial ports).
command: ls -l /dev/null 


question two: Whatâ€™s the difference between a hard link and a symbolic link? Give real examples of when to use each.

Hard Link: an additional name (directory entry) for the same file data on disk. It points directly to the inode
example: if you need a certain file in more than one directory and you may delete one of them and you need the data to be saved.

Symbolic Link: A symbolic link is a separate file that contains a path to another file or directory. It's like a shortcut.
example: it is like a file and we make a shortcut to other directory to open it quickly.
