question one: Explain the different types of files in Linux (regular, directory, symbolic link, device, etc.) and how to check them with commands.

regular: The most common type. Contains data, text, scripts, images, binaries, etc.
command: ls -l filename

directory: A special file that contains references (entries) to other files and directories.
command: ls -ld directoryname

symbolic link: A pointer to another file or directory. It's like a shortcut.
command: ls -l symlink_name

Hard Link: Another name for an existing file (points to the same inode).it's like a copy.
command: ls -l

device: Provides unbuffered access to hardware devices, one character at a time (e.g., terminals, serial ports).
command: ls -l /dev/null
